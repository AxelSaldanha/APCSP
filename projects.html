    <h4>This is a picture that of Ghana's flag that I made using pyret. I made it in APCSP because we had to make a country's flag using graphic design. This made me have to code a lot and I learned a lot about using functions to simplify code.</h4>

    <h4>This last piece was my performance tast project. I worked with two of my friends on this project. We had to make a project for the performance task in APCSP. This meant that we had to use a ton of different functions and so on. I learned a ton about writing functions and a lot of already set up functions.</h4>
